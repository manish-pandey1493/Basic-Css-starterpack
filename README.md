# Basic-Css-starterpack
Basic CSS starter package with responsive containers.

The primary intention behind this resource is to equip early-stage developers with a basic framework that enables them to grasp key concepts and principles of web design. By incorporating carefully curated elements, such as a responsive grid system and adaptable typography styles, this library supports the creation of layouts that seamlessly adapt to varying screen sizes.

P.S - This isn't a whole CSS library. Just the basics that lets you start deep diving into CSS.
